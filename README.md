# Employee-Tracker
Unit 12 MySQL Assignment. UW Coding Boot Camp.

## Description

Developers are often tasked with creating interfaces that make it easy for non-developers to view and interact with information stored in databases. Often these interfaces are known as **C**ontent **M**anagement **S**ystems. In this homework assignment, our challenge is to architect and build a solution for managing a company's employees using node, inquirer, and MySQL.

This assignment allows for more practice with mysql and databases. Each component-function allows us to build on functionality. Creating a department will allow you to create a role which will in turn allow you to add an employee to that role. For development purposes, I used a seed.sql to populate 3 tables of employee information including departments, roles and existing employees. Additional conponent-functions were added to allow for deleting employees, roles and departments.
